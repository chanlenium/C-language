<What I learned while doing workshop>
While I doing workshop, I mainly learned about Arrays and Debugging.
Array is the data structure which can store the primitive type of data such as int, char, double, float, and so on. 
The array is the simplest data structure where each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number. 
In this workshop, I used three arrays to store Day, High temperature, and Low temperature data. 
By receiving input data and checking the validity of the inputs, I figured out high and low temperatures. 
To derive high/low temperatures, firstly I stored each data into arrays. 
Then, by comparing each components each other, I figure out high and low temperatures as well as their indices. 
By using the array, I can reduce variable declarations and easily access the data that I want.
I also done Debugging while I correct my code with syntactic and semantic errors.
In visual studio, user can run line-by-line or block-by-block by selecting break points.
By doing these, I could identify intermediate results, and figure out which part of my code is wrong and the reason easily.

<What was good about using arrays>
By using arrays, we can reduce code length when many variable with same data type are need to be declared.
In addition, the elements in arrays can be accessed randomly by using the index number. 

<Comment on the use of parallel array’s>
In parallel arrays, one of the array holds the key, while the others hold values. In this workshop, day array performs as key, and high/low temperature arrays performs as values. The arrays are parallel since the elements at the same index hold data that are related to one another. 
Parallel arrays are simple to process and intuitive. 
However, it requires additional memory to store key values.

<Iterating through arrays is a common practice; Why is it a best practice to initialize iterator variables to a value of zero?>
In an array, Index numbering for each element starts at 0. 
Therefore, practice to initialize iterator variables to a value of zero is the best way.
