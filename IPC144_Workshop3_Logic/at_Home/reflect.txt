In this workshop, I learned about conditional and iteration expressions. Especially, I tried to use 'while', 'do-while', and 'for' constructs.
Three instructions control the execution of an iteration: an initialization, a test condition, a change statement.
To solve the problem given in workshop, I described logic and type code.
Although it was somewhat hard to describe pseudo code while predicting results, it was good experience for me to think computationally.  



1. Pseudo code is a method that makes programmers think computationally.
Pseudo code is readable sentence, so by describing pseudo-code before tying code, the programmers can reduce logical error.
Instead of using pseudo code, I often use Flow chart since it is intuitive and easy understandable.



2. for, while, do-while

   I used for loop condition, since it performs iteratively if the condition is satisfied

.
   I also used while for condition check.

3. I ran the code step by step, and checked the intreim results. If the interim results were wrong, I ckecked condition in loop and found error.
Then, I corrected the error, and ran the code agian. I performed these actions again and again to test my soulution.
